Sync a github repo to a USO user.

Usage
-----

By default, node-uso-github (from now on, we will abbreviate this to NUG), will
store the scripts in `scripts.json`. This path can be changed in `config.js` to
whatever you please. Its structure is (has to be `JSON.parse`-able):

    {
      "uso_custom_search/script.user.js": {
        "id": 88396,
        "topic": 62116
      },
      "download_youtube_caption/script.user.js": {
        "id": 50003,
        "topic": null
      }
    }

Make sure you predefine scripts that are already on USO, and are also in one of
your repositories - otherwise NUG will try to re-create the user-script, likely
resulting in USO rejecting it due to a duplicate name. Otherwise you will have
two of the same script with different names (in the case you changed it
somewhere along the line).

You then should enter your USO username (e-mail address) and password into the
`config.js`, the desired `port` to listen on, then start it as a daemon with:

    nuhup node lib/server.js &

or set it up with your favorite process manager, like upstart and monit for
example.

In the Github repository settings, go to service hooks and add a post-recieve
URL to the following:

    http://ip.or.host.com:port/hook

where `hook` is set in `config.js` as `hook_path`.

You should now be good to go.
